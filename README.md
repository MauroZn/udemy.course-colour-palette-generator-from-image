## Assignment
One of my favourite websites to go to when I'm designing anything is a colour palette website called Flat UI Colors. https://flatuicolors.com/palette/defo <br>
It's a really simple static website that shows a bunch of colours and their HEX codes. I can copy the HEX codes and use it in my CSS or any design software. <br>
On day 76, you learnt about image processing with NumPy. Using this knowledge and your developer skills, build a website where a user can upload an image and you will tell them what are the top 10 most common colours in that image.
